## Features in Detail

### Smart Autopick Algorithm
The autopick system uses a weighted scoring model:
- **40%** - Base player value (ranking)
- **30%** - Positional need based on roster requirements
- **15%** - Position scarcity in remaining player pool
- **10%** - Tier considerations (bonus for last player in tier)
- **5%** - ADP value (players falling past their ADP)

Additional adjustments:
- Avoids drafting backup QB/TE/K/DST too early
- Recognizes Zero-RB and Zero-WR strategies
- Penalizes extreme reaches
- Adds slight randomness for realism

### Keeper System
- Assign any undrafted player to any team
- Specify the round for each keeper
- Keepers are locked into their assigned rounds
- Visual indicators show keeper selections

### Export Options
- **CSV**: Simple draft results table
- **Excel**: Multi-sheet workbook with detailed analysis
- **JSON**: Structured data for programmatic use
- **HTML**: Formatted report with styling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**
   - Ensure all packages are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Update pip if needed: `pip install --upgrade pip`

2. **File Upload Issues**
   - Ensure CSV file follows the expected format
   - Check for special characters in player names
   - Verify column names match expected values

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Restart the Streamlit server
   - Reduce number of rounds if needed

## Tips for Best Experience

1. **Draft Strategy**
   - Use the tier information to identify value picks
   - Monitor position runs in the Analysis tab
   - Watch for players falling past their ADP

2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - Use browser refresh (F5) to reset if needed
   - Ctrl+F to search for specific players

3. **Mobile Usage**
   - The app is mobile-responsive
   - Use landscape mode for best draft board view
   - Zoom out to see more of the board at once

## Future Enhancements
- Trade analyzer
- Dynasty league support
- Custom scoring settings
- Mock draft history tracking
- AI draft grades and recommendations
- Integration with live draft platforms
